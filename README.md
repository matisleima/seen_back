## description
This is the back end code of a prototype web app for sharing mushroom picking spots which is
an absolutely unwanted and never occuring thing in the life of mushroom-loving
people of Estonia. These places have been family secrets for decades and this app
is here to shamefully break that tradition.

## instructions
The backend utilizes a PostgreSQL database and contains pre-existing 
data (via dedicated SQL scripts in the Database package) for demo purposes. As of Oct 19 2023, integration with an H2 database is 
yet to come. 

### NB!
NEVER share the whereabouts of a mushroom picking spot that you didn't discover yourself!

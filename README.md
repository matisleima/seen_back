## description
This is the back end code of a prototype web app for sharing mushroom picking spots which is
an absolutely unwanted and never occuring thing in the life of mushroom-loving
people of Estonia. These places have been family secrets for decades and this app
is here to shamefully break that tradition.

## instructions
This application can be used with a PostgreSQL local database or with a
H2 in-memory database. Please choose one by typing either "postgres" or "h2"
to the "Active profiles" input area in Run Configurations.

### NB!
NEVER share the whereabouts of a mushroom picking spot that you didn't discover yourself!
